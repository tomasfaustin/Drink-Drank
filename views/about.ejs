    <p>Currently I am gaining skills necessary to be a full stack developer at General Assembly . Previously I worked in sales with AT&T and honed my communication skills, leading by example, provided exemplary customer service, and training the sales team on best practices and techniques. Working and meeting with different types of individuals helped me learn to communicate with anyone. Being a lead in store designer with converse taught me to take information from customers and turn their ideas into a viable product/piece of art. I even worked with companies like Naughty Dog and HULU by providing custom shoes for employees and their companies. I also learned how to take constructive criticism, as many times product needed to be altered and updated to make the customer happy. Through these job experiences I was able to develop the ability to keep a level head in almost any situation. This also taught me patience in dealing with problems and issues.</p>

    <p>I’ve always been a logical problem solver. Before GA, I was working between completing a Bachelor’s in Computer Science at Cal State University Fullerton and being a Product Designer at PhD Labs – but I was looking to further my growth as a programmer and also as an individual. CSUF and PhD Labs both taught me the fundamentals of coding and design and made me want to pursue a future in web development. WDI was exactly what I needed to flourish – a high pressure learning environment that would help me grow as a Full-Stack Web Developer. Prior to GA I had experience using C++, C#, Objective C, Python, Ruby on Rails, and Assembly, and GA was able to expand that knowledge by introducing JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and JQuery. With all of these languages at my disposal I now feel like I am fully able to take on anything the web development world has to offer.

As a lifelong equestrian and former kennel manager, my years of experience caring for animals has given me a solid foundation and self confidence needed to tackle any problem that comes my way. My previous experiences have given me a large skill set applicable to any job environment. Working with large and small animals, I have learned quick thinking and am fast to react, and remaining calm, especially in emergency situations. These experiences have allowed me to be quick and adaptable to new environments.  I’ve always been interested in the technical side of things, and began tinkering with languages like HTML and CSS as a child. Drawing from prior experiences and applying what I have absorbed to my studies in WDI has allowed me to learn and understand things I had always wanted to learn, in a very short amount of time. Following WDI, I wish to combine my love of programming, animals, and social services to create useable products to better serve the communities I am involved with.</p>

    <p>Prior to starting at General Assembly, I’ve owned a personal training business, played in the Austin, TX music scene for many years, and taught SAT prep in Korea, among other pursuits. But learning front-end and full-stack development languages and frameworks has solidified my desire to keep building things that ultimately help people improve their lives.
